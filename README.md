# fps-increase-ml
An advanced machine learning project for increasing the frame rate of videos using frame interpolation techniques. This project utilizes deep learning to intelligently generate intermediate frames, resulting in smoother video playback without altering the original speed.
🚀 Features

Train custom ML models for frame interpolation
Increase video FPS without changing playback speed
Utilize GPU acceleration for faster processing
Seamless integration with Google Colab for easy use
Persistent model storage using Google Drive
User-friendly command-line interface
